Revision history for Perl extension Apache::Throttle.

0.02  Tue Sept 15 12:42:48 1998
        - Put the CVS $Id: Changes,v 1.3 1998/09/15 18:10:51 don Exp $ lines in single quotes, not double.
        - Changed the permissions on the speed hash.
        - Set Apache::Throttle::Log to empty the hash when it
          becomes too full.  I'm still looking for a better
          solution for this.
        - Changed the $DEBUG variable to an Apache config
          variable.
