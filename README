Apache::Throttle - Apache/Perl module for speed-based content negotiation

Apache::Throttle is a package designed to allow Apache webservers to
negotiate content based on the speed of the connection.

It's primary purpose is to transparently send smaller (lower
resolution/quality) images to users with slow internet connections,
but it can also be used for many other purposes.

Prerequisites:
  * Apache w/ mod_perl
  * IPC::Shareable
  * Time::HiRes and Image::Magick are also recommended.

Quick Start:
  1) "perl Makefile.PL"
  2) "make"
  3) "make install"
  4) add the following lines to one of your Apache config files:
         PerlTransHandler   Apache::Throttle
         PerlFixUpHandler   Apache::Throttle::Log
  5) "apachectl restart" (or send the main httpd process a -HUP signal)
  6) "throttleimg <a gif or jpeg in your Apache htdocs root>"
  7) Browse around your site with a web browser for a while from a remote
     machine, making sure that it loads at least one file larger than 64k.
  8) Request the file that you ran throttleimg on earlier.  It should load
     in approximately 5 seconds, regardless of your connection speed.
  9) See the manpages for Apache::Throttle, Apache::Throttle::Log, and 
     throttleimg for information on changing the defaults.
 10) Good luck. :-)
